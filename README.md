Our independent CMT implementation is integrated with the [latest code](https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper/) and with [prior releasees](https://github.com/pepper-project/releases/) since Ginger.

(Specifically: Ginger, Allspice, Zaatar, Pantry, and Buffet all contain this implementation.)

Improved documentation on using this backend is forthcoming. In the meantime, please feel free to contact us and/or explore [the relevant code](https://github.com/pepper-project/pepper/tree/master/pepper/cmtgkr).

The CMT backend is based upon

Cormode, G., Mitzenmacher, M., and Thaler, J. "[Practical Verified Computation with Streaming Interactive Proofs.](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~jthaler/PracticalVerifiedComputation.html)" Proc. ACM ITCS, 2012.
